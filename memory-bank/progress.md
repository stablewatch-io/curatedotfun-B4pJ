## Known Issues
- None critical - System is stable and operational
- Configuration management needs to be moved to database for better versioning and security
- Error handling needs to be more comprehensive
- Test coverage needs to be expanded
- Database security needs to be enhanced for Web3Auth integration

## Feed Status
- Active feeds: Multiple (Ethereum, NEAR, Solana, Grants, AI, etc.)
- Curator networks: Established for all active feeds
- Distribution channels: Operational for all active feeds
